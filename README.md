## stock-cutter

Simple, fast, one-file linear material cutting calculator. It uses greedy-kind of algorithm and doesn't yield global optimum solution, but the solutions are good enough to compete with other 1D-cutters available online. The algorithm is written in non-recursive way and is much faster than many other cutters available. It is also able to accept and compute solutions for very large and diverse inputs.

If you want to use it offline, download one of the releases, in english (default) or polish.
